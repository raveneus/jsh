NAME
    jsh - the Java shell

SYNOPSIS
    jsh [-r resource-file]

DESCRIPTION
    jsh is the Java shell. The control structures
    (if, else, loops, etc.) will use similar syntax
    to Java. It is the one shell I know of that
    implements classes. It is capable of command
    substitution, variable subsitution, arithmetic,
    resource file parsing, command execution,
    regular expression matching, string
    concatenation, string multiplication (yes,
    that's a thing), and has extensive help
    pages like this one. Soon, though, it will
    be capable of much more.

OPTIONS
    -r resource-file
         Parse the resource-file instead of STDIN
